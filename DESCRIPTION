Description: Contains helper functions for importing and working with flow 
    cytometry data in R. Highlights include gs_create, which creates a 
    gatingset from a list of fortessa-exported fcs files (might work with 
    other cytometers too but I don't know) and gs_pregate which exports 
    gated subpopulations based only on an input gatingset object and the 
    gating strategy to use.
