# flowHelpers
helper functions for flow cytometry work in R

This is a package meant to make it easier to work on and use my helper functions
for flow cytometry data in R. Unlike flowGate, this package is not intended for
distribution (though it isn't secret by any stretch)---it might/will be jankier
than flowGate and won't have any vignettes most likely, and won't be
bioconductor-formatted at all. Just a way to have one central place to keep all
my personal flow functions and then bring them into other software easily.
